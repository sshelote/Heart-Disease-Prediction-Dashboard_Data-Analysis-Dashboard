## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyse health-related data to identify the factors most associated with heart disease. The Power BI dashboard aims to provide clear insights into how lifestyle choices, demographics, and general health indicators contribute to the risk of heart disease. This can help health professionals and individuals make better health decisions.

### Dataset Overview
**The dataset includes multiple health, demographic, and lifestyle factors:**

•	<ins> HeartDisease:</ins> Target variable indicating if the person has heart disease.

•	<ins> BMI:</ins> Body Mass Index.

•	<ins> Smoking:</ins> Whether the person smokes.

•	<ins> AlcoholDrinking:</ins> Alcohol consumption status.

•	<ins> Stroke:</ins> Stroke history.

•	<ins> PhysicalHealth:</ins> Number of physically unhealthy days.

•	<ins> MentalHealth:</ins> Number of mentally unhealthy days.

•	<ins> DiffWalking:</ins> Difficulty walking.

• <ins>	Sex:</ins> Gender.

•	<ins> AgeCategory:</ins> Age range.

•	<ins> Race:</ins> Race or ethnicity.

•	<ins> Diabetic:</ins> Diabetes status.

•	<ins> PhysicalActivity:</ins> Engagement in physical activity.

•	<ins> GenHealth:</ins> General health rating.

•	<ins> SleepTime:</ins> Average sleep hours per day.

•	<ins> Asthma:</ins> Asthma diagnosis.

•	<ins> KidneyDisease:</ins> Kidney disease diagnosis.

•	<ins> SkinCancer:</ins> Skin cancer diagnosis.

### Steps Followed

**1. Data Loading & Cleaning**

- Imported the dataset into Power BI.

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

- Converted Yes/No, gender, and age categories into readable formats.

**2. Dashboard Visualizations**

- Heart Disease by Lifestyle Factors

- Smoking: Visualized number of smokers and non-smokers with heart disease.

- Alcohol Consumption: Compared alcohol drinkers and non-drinkers.

- Physical Activity: Showed how activity levels impact heart disease presence.

**Demographic Impact**

- Gender Distribution: Pie chart showing heart disease proportion by gender.

- Race & Gender Analysis: Horizontal bar charts showing how race and gender affect heart disease prevalence.

**Health Metrics**

- Physical and Mental Health: Clustered bar chart showing average physical and mental health scores.

- BMI vs Sleep Time: Scatter plot for heart disease status by sleep and BMI, filtered by diabetic status.

### Key Insights

People who are physically inactive, smoke, or drink alcohol show higher chances of heart disease.

Individuals with poor physical and mental health scores are more likely to have heart conditions.

Gender and race influence the distribution of heart disease in the dataset.

BMI and sleep duration reveal trends for specific groups, especially those with diabetes.

### Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard provides a clear and visual representation of factors influencing heart disease. It can help guide preventative strategies and raise awareness of how lifestyle and health indicators impact heart conditions.
